# RSNA_2025-MambaVesselNet
RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection using MambaVesselNet++ architecture.

‚ú® Description

Medical image segmentation is essential for accurate computer-aided diagnosis. While Vision Transformers have achieved great success, their quadratic self-attention mechanism leads to high computational costs. The recently proposed Mamba state space model provides an efficient alternative for capturing long-range dependencies with reduced memory usage.

In this work, we apply the MambaVesselNet++ architecture ‚Äî a hybrid CNN-Mamba framework ‚Äî to the RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection 2025
dataset using MRA scans. We adapt the original model to perform binary vessel segmentation, converting the original multi-class labels into vessel (1) and background (0).

Our customized RSNA-MambaVesselNet++ effectively models both local texture details and long-range spatial dependencies, achieving robust vessel segmentation performance suitable for clinical aneurysm
